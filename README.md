# üî∞ LipNet-Buddy: Deep Learning for Image Processing

## üî∞ Introduction

This tutorial is a structured summary of the research work I conducted during my postgraduate studies. While organizing my own learning, I hope it can also serve as a useful resource for others interested in deep learning and image processing. I‚Äôll continue updating this series as I explore new topics.

üì∫ The tutorials are shared in **video format**, and each topic will follow this learning structure:

- Introduction to the network architecture and its innovations  
- Implementing and training the model using **PyTorch**  
- Implementing and training the model using **TensorFlow (Keras module)**  

üìÇ All PowerPoint slides used in the courses are stored in the `course_ppt` folder‚Äîfeel free to download them as needed.
